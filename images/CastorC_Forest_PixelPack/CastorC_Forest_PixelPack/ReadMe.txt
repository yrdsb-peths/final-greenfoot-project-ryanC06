Thanks for purchasing the Castor's Forest Pixelpack Tileset! I really apreciate this from the bottom of my heart!

Now, please take these notes serious for a better usage:

	-With the trees, use layers where the lighter ones are in the front, and then
	put the other trees behind using the layers to create a good profoundity effect!
	
	-With the Hills made of leaves, use the darker one always being in the front, and the lighter one behind.

	-The assets composing the visual far away, follow the same logic of the Hills as well.

	-Stay tuned! I can be upgrading this Asset Pack in the future!
	
	-Also, be sure to leave a comment, this helps a lot <3
